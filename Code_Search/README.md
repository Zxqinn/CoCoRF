# CoCoRF
We propose a comment-based data refinement framework utilizing unsupervised and supervised co-learning. It applies manually defined rules for syntax filtering and utilizes the WTFF mining algorithm to construct bootstrap query corpus for training the TVAE model to further semantic filtering.

The primary structure of the project is as follows:

```python
- data                  # directory to store the vocab
- main_model            # directory to store the vae model
- models                # architecture of DeepCS     
- output                # directory to store the trained model
- processed_dataset_csn # directory to store the filtered and processed dataset
- raw_dataset           # directory to store the CodeSearchNet dataset
- configs.py            # the configuration file for DeepCS
- data_loader.py        # the data loader for DeepCS
- filtering.py          # our data filtering and processing script for DeepCS
- modules.py            # the modules for DeepCS
- python_structured.py  # extracting python language features
- repr_code.py          # the script to evaluate DeepCS model
- train.py              # the script to train DeepCS model
- utils.py              # utility functions for DeepCS
```

The project requires Python3.6 and the following packages:

```python
jsonlines
pandas
javalang==0.12.0
nltk
torch==1.3.1
numpy
tqdm
tables==3.4.3
```

## Filter the dataset and process the filtered dataset into a format that can be used by DeepCS.

Run the following command for filteringï¼š

```python
python filtering.py
```

The filtered and processed dataset is saved in ```./processed_dataset/```. We have pre-run this command and generated a processed dataset in this directory. Here we have uploaded only the processed data from the attention-based VAE model, for other models and their processing generated data click [here]([URL] "https://github.com/Zxqinn/CSNMF/tree/main") to download.

## Train the code search model on the filtered dataset.

Run the following command to train the model:

```python
python train.py
```

The trained model is saved in ```./output/```. We have pre-run this command and obtained a trained model ```./output/epo100.h5```.

## Evaluate the performance of the trained model.

Run the following command to evaluate the trained model:

```python
python repr_code.py
```

The evaluation results will be printed in the terminal.
